# Abode

Abode is a TypeScript Node.js Backend that is built to support [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) principles. The front-end is currently built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

This website is used to power [EddieHinkle.com](http://eddiehinkle.com), some of the current currently might be geared to this design. Over time I plan to make less and less of Abode dependent on my needs and more generic for general use.
