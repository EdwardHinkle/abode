like-context: "Short update today, I just added a page to the Quill docs that documents the Favoriting interface.<br>I actually had a cat on my lap, and my computer was not within arms reach, so I actually did the whole thing from my phone. This was an interesting exercise in editing the site using Coda for iOS, and taking and editing screenshots using only my phone, and mostly one hand because the other was stuck under a cat."
