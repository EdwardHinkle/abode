like-context: "I finally have checkins on my website!<br>This has been on my todo list for years. I even started a prototype way back in 2013 before I built the first version of p3k. Today I dug up some sketches I had done last April/May, and for some reason felt like I could actually code this up today. It has helped that a lot of the discussion in IRC about checkins has started to solidify."
