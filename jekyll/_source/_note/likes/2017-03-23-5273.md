like-context: "Beginning a slow project of updating the docs about the IndieAuth spec, today I started by updating a few pages on the wiki. Right now, most of the docs about IndieAuth (the spec), and how to use it, live across a variety of pages on the wiki, grouped together at <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/Category:IndieAuth\">https://indieweb.org/Category:IndieAuth</a>."
