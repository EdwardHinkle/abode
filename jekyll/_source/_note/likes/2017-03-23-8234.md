like-context: "I've been feeling like the <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/Webmention\">Webmention page</a> on the IndieWeb wiki doesn't do a very good job of explaining what Webmention does for users, and jumps too quickly into spec details. I would like to be able to direct people at this page when I am talking to them online about what Webmention can do, which often means what I am trying to show them is how Webmention can be used to display comments and other interactions on a website. Today I started to make some incremental improvements."
