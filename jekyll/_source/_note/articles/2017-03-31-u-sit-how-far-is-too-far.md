Well this takes wearable tech to a new level... [uSit by Quilted Northern](https://www.quiltednorthern.com/usit) is designed to "Log every sit" (on the toilet), earn daily badges, setting personalized goals and allows you to compete with friends in "Battle Sits".

I'm pretty sure that this is an early April Fool's Day joke. I am traditionally a HUGE supporter of wearable tech, however as it becomes more and more mainstream, we will have to ask ourselves the question...how far is too far when it comes to storing our data.

Who knows maybe this isn't an April Fool's Day joke, and soon we'll have a way to track our time in the bathroom. In which case, I'm guessing [Aaron](https://aaronparecki.com) might be working on "OwnYourSits"? Either way, I would probably pass on this wearable tech...or at least enable all the privacy settings.
