reply-context: "Imagine visiting a site's landing page, getting a description and some screenshots, and then seeing a button that says \"$1.99 for full access\". If, as a user, you could click on that button, enter a password, and then immediately have lifelong access to the site â€“ I bet you'd do it. $1.99 is a price lots of people are willing to pay, even if there's a risk involved with trying out the site and then finding out you don't like it."

I ran across this article from 2009, it was an interesting thought piece. But one thing that sticks out to me is how much the iOS App Store has changed in the years since this was written. Back in 2009, you could sell an app pretty easily for $1.99 but in 2017 it is highly unlikely that anyone will pay $0.99 before being able to download and use your app. Instead of the web becoming more like the App Store, the App Store has actually become more like the web, trying to make an income off of subscription services or ads.
