This is the conundrum with static sites in the IndieWeb world. How do you enable a live, real-time engaging site when your site is built to be static?

My solution thus far has been to build a node.js app that runs on the same site as my Jekyll server. Iâ€™m actually using a lot of node.js to rebuild my site: When my git repo gets a new commit or when I hit a secret URL and soon, when my site receives a micropub request, it causes Jekyll to pull down new code from the repo. Then it runs a local node.js script that fetches recent Goodreads data that gets dumped in my Jekyll /data directory, and Jekyll gets rebuilt with all of the data. The other situation I came across was if I updated Goodreads but nothing else. For that case I decided daily was frequently enough so at 2am my time, my site always rebuilds (again caused by my node.js back engine).
