reply-context: "Against considerable opposition from family and friends, Patrick left his newfound comforts and gave his life to the cause of gospel advancement among the Irish, who were known for idol worship. Enduring insults from unbelievers, slander from believers, imprisonment and discomfort, he held to his belief that Ireland needed Christ...After just a few decades, more than a thousand Irish would profess faith, by Patrickâ€™s own reports."

Wow... we experience St. Patrick's Day every year, but you would never believe the background behind who this man is and what he did for Ireland.
