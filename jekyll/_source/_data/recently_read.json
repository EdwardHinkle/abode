No matter what need brings a group of people together—from marriage enrichment to divorce recovery, from grief recovery to spiritual formation—members are part of a small group because they want to grow. This book by psychologists Henry Cloud and John Townsend provides small-group leaders with valuable guidance and information on how they can help their groups to grow spiritually, emotionally, and relationally. With insights from their best-selling book How People Grow, Cloud and Townsend show how God’s plan for growth is made up of three key elements: grace plus truth plus time. When groups embrace those elements, they find God’s grace and forgiveness and learn how to handle their imperfections without shame as they model God’s love and support to one another. In addition to describing what makes small groups work, Leading Small Groups That Help People Grow explains the roles and responsibilities of both leaders and group members. Employing tenets from the book How People Grow, this book equips leaders to understand the ins and outs of how to promote growth, and using principles from their best-selling book Boundaries, they show how to identify and find solutions for common problems such as boredom, noncompliance, passivity, aggression, narcissism, spiritualization, over-neediness, over-giving, and nonstop talking."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["1114699"],"name":["Henry Cloud"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1396388859p5/1114699.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1396388859p2/1114699.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1114699.Henry_Cloud"],"average_rating":["4.19"],"ratings_count":["55838"],"text_reviews_count":["3630"]}]}],"published":["2003"]},{"id":[{"_":"34470440","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"0","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Before You Launch: Pain Killers For Church Planters"],"title_without_series":["Before You Launch: Pain Killers For Church Planters"],"image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34470440-before-you-launch"],"num_pages":[""],"format":[""],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":[""],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":[""],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["5.00"],"ratings_count":["2"],"description":[""],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["428681"],"name":["Ralph Moore"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1301110295p5/428681.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1301110295p2/428681.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/428681.Ralph_Moore"],"average_rating":["3.89"],"ratings_count":["122"],"text_reviews_count":["23"]}]}],"published":[""]},{"id":[{"_":"17341752","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"11","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Jonah"],"title_without_series":["Jonah"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1360351909m/17341752.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1360351909s/17341752.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17341752-jonah"],"num_pages":["4"],"format":[""],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":[""],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":[""],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["4.54"],"ratings_count":["71"],"description":["Book 32 of the Old Testament"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["5158478"],"name":["Anonymous"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5158478.Anonymous"],"average_rating":["4.13"],"ratings_count":["964479"],"text_reviews_count":["49474"]}]}],"published":[""]},{"id":[{"_":"13700189","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0310273978"],"isbn13":["9780310273974"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"11","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Organic Outreach for Families: Turning Your Home into a Lighthouse"],"title_without_series":["Organic Outreach for Families: Turning Your Home into a Lighthouse"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1346944839m/13700189.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1346944839s/13700189.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13700189-organic-outreach-for-families"],"num_pages":["191"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Zondervan"],"publication_day":["28"],"publication_year":["2012"],"publication_month":["10"],"average_rating":["4.11"],"ratings_count":["27"],"description":["In Organic Outreach for Families, Kevin and Sherry Harney share insights from the Scriptures and give practical advice from their own experience to help you learn how to transform your home into a lighthouse of God's amazing grace.andnbsp;andnbsp;
