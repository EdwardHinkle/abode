According to John Piper, the pursuit of pleasure in God is not only permissible, it’s <i>essential</i>.<br /><br /><i>Desiring God</i> is a paradigm-shattering work that dramatically alters common perspectives on relating to God.  Piper reveals that there really is no need to choose between duty and delight in the Christian life. In fact, for the follower of Jesus, delight is the duty as Christ is most magnified in His people when they are most satisfied in Him.<br /><br />Constantly drawing on Scripture to build his case, Piper shows why pursuing maximum joy is essential to glorifying God. He discusses the implications of this for conversion, worship, love, Scripture, prayer, money, marriage, missions, and suffering.<br /><br />Piper beckons us to approach God with the hedonist’s abandon. Finally, we are freed to enjoy Jesus—not only as our Lord and Savior, but also as our all-surpassing, soul-satisfying Treasure.<br /><br /><i>Desiring God</i> may turn your Christian world upside down. And that will be a good thing, for the glory of God, and for your deepest joy.<br /><br /><br /><i>Includes study guide for individual and small group use.<br /><br /></i><br /><br /><br /><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["25423"],"name":["John Piper"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1384812074p5/25423.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1384812074p2/25423.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/25423.John_Piper"],"average_rating":["4.19"],"ratings_count":["111449"],"text_reviews_count":["6277"]}]}],"published":[""]},{"id":[{"_":"13789093","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["080101459X"],"isbn13":["9780801014598"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"130","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["The Art of Neighboring: Building Genuine Relationships Right Outside Your Door"],"title_without_series":["The Art of Neighboring: Building Genuine Relationships Right Outside Your Door"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1340808128m/13789093.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1340808128s/13789093.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13789093-the-art-of-neighboring"],"num_pages":[""],"format":[""],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":[""],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":[""],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["3.78"],"ratings_count":["928"],"description":["What if Jesus meant that we should love our actual neighbors?<br /><br />When Jesus was asked to sum up everything into one command, he said to love God with everything we have and to love our neighbors as ourselves.
