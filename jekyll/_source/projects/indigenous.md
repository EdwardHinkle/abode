**Indigenous** is an iOS app that is in development. It's goal is to provide a native iOS interface to the [indieweb movement](http://indieweb.org).

## Features

### Version 1.0
The goal of version 1 is to allow a user to use a simple share extension for iOS and macOS for posting your website using [Micropub](https://indieweb.org/micropub).

* Share URL
    * Note in response to URL
    * Note quoting URL
    * Like URL
    * Bookmark URL
* Share Photo
* ... Thinking through others

### Version 2.0
The goal of version 2 will be to routinely fetch webmentions from an external service (like [webmention.io](http://webmention.io) or a personal website that makes that available) and to display those as iOS notifications.

## IndieWeb Interest
