Abode is a series of software and services that all work together to create a seamless user experience, equivilent to what you might experience on Facebook or Twitter.

* Abode Publish/Core is the central storage/authentication/micropub piece.
* Gateway is automatically installed by default with Abode Core. Gateway is a micropub publishing service that by default can be found at `/gateway` on your domain. It's built as it's own open source module so that it could be used by others as well.
* There should be something that enables you to read things from your friends/etc and respond, basically like a personal Facebook Newsfeed.

* Indigenous is a local client on a device that enables the user to post micropub to Abode Core quickly and easily as you would Facebook/Twitter/Instagram, etc. Are there other features I want to enable? Recieve push notifications from webmentions?
* Inscribe is a micropub media check-in responsive web app.
